### ðŸš€ Centralized Observability Stack with Grafana, Loki, Promtail, Prometheus & Node Exporter

This project demonstrates a full logging and monitoring pipeline using modern open-source observability tools. It collects application logs, system metrics, and container metadata and visualizes them through Grafana dashboards.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Grafana (v11.6.0) â€“ Dashboarding and visualization

- Prometheus â€“ Metrics scraping and time-series database

- Node Exporter â€“ System-level metrics collection

- Loki â€“ Centralized log storage with retention policy (72h)

- Promtail â€“ Log shipping from Docker containers & Nginx logs, enriched with metadata (container name, ID, image, project, service)

- OpenTelemetry â€“ Application metrics exposed via /metrics endpoint

- Docker Compose â€“ Easy one-command setup


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdulwasay10/Production-Ready-Centralized-Observability-Socker-Stack.git
   cd Production-Ready-Centralized-Observability-Socker-Stack
   ```

2. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access services:

- Grafana â†’ http://localhost:3101

- Prometheus â†’ http://localhost:9090

- Loki â†’ http://localhost:3100

- Node Exporter â†’ http://localhost:9100

4. ðŸ“Š Grafana Dashboards

Logs filtered by container names / services / projects

System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)

Application telemetry via /metrics

5. Why This Project?

1. This setup simulates a production-ready observability stack:

2. Logs + Metrics in one place (Loki + Prometheus)

3. Enriched logs with container metadata

Dashboards that help debug across apps, infra, and logs

Easy to replicate for any environment using Docker Compose
